    "In this homework, your goal is to predict the solubility of a compound, and to reach to lowest possible error on the test set. To make this homework a little more interactive, you should report your score on a scoreboard: https://keepthescore.co/board/cmdaqeorufe/ <br> For this homework, you will use a library called score, which provides you with 3 functions. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> featurize(dataset,features): dataset should be a CSV file with at least two columns: SMILES and Solubility. features should be a list of mordred features. Returns two numpy tensors, one with the result of the feature calculation, one with the target. \n",
    "    <li> test(features,model): features should be a list of mordred features. model should be a scikit learn estimator. return the mean average error on the test set.\n",
    "    <li> report(teamname): teaname should be your team name, per the canvas group assignment. Effect: records your current score on the scoreboard.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, you will find an example on how to train a model, test it, and report a score. Note that you are allowed to use my featurize function for your featurization. If you want to use 3D features, please contact me. You should use datasets A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I for your work. You are encouraged to use multiple datasets!<br>\n",
    "One final note: you will not be graded based on the scoreboard. Of course, there might be some anticorrelation between your test score and your grade, but you need not worry about the scoreboard."
