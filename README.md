# Predicting Solubility
### By Robert Smithers and Ronan Manvelian

Given molecular features, we seek to better estimate solubility. This has large implications for major pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our eventual goal is to outperform some of the leading models using various machine learning models and optimizations.

This project is based off of a Machine Learning with Applications to Chemistry course with Professor Tristan.
